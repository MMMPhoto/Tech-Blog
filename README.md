# Tech-Blog

## Description

The Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site that runs Node.js, Express, and Sequelize to access a SQL database on the server side, and utilizes the Express-Handlebars package to generate views for the client side. The site has the ability for users to create an account and log in, make posts, view other users posts, add a comment to existing posts, and update and delete their own posts. The user, post, and comment data is all saved in the SQL database using Sequelize. The site also uses the Express-Session package to create a server side cookie that stores the user data and expires after 10 minutes, logging out the user.
